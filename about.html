        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey there!!! I am still a noob traveller. My first trek was so adventerous and it is regarded as the highest peak between Himalayas and Nilgiris, Mullayanagiri peak is one of the best treks in Karnataka. The peak gets its name from a small temple at the summit, which is dedicated to a sage Mullappa Swamy, who is believed to have meditated at the cave near the summit.Regarded as the highest peak between Himalayas and Nilgiris, Mullayanagiri peak is one of the best treks in Karnataka. The peak gets its name from a small temple at the summit, which is dedicated to a sage Mullappa Swamy, who is believed to have meditated at the cave near the summit.Mullayyanagiri peak can be reached by road without requiring extensive trekking. A small hike involving close to 500 steps is required from the parking lot to reach Mullayyanagiri peak. Mullayyanagiri Peak offers an excellent view of western ghats, captivating sunset and cool breeze. Mullayyanagiri peak can be visited all around the year. There is one spot from where trekking usually begins so you can either park your vehicles there and trek your way up the peak or you may drive further up to where you will have to climb those 500 steps.</p>
